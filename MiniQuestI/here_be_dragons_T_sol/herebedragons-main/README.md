# HereBeDragons

This mini-quest portrays the classical situation of "The Maze and The Dragon".
The mini-quest is implemented in C++ and was compiled in VS Code. See the
[`guide`](doc/lprog_mini-quest-1_here-be-dragons.pdf) for more information about
the mini-quest.

Only the common part of the mini-quest is implemented in C++, just as in the
Java version ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EgeWkYzCkg)). The YouTube
video for the latter is also valid for C++ in terms of logic and program
structure.
